# Camp 404 Machine Learning Fundamentals Bootcamp
 I am taking Camp 404 Machine Learning Fundamentals bootcamp where we learn about the basic programming of Python. 
 
 Their classes consist of:
 1. Work with Python
    * startpython.py

 2. Data Processing
    * hello.py

 3. Machine Learning Basics
    * curve.py

The class seems to talk about the basics of Python. It is very good for beginners as it goes over basic functions and data types in Python. I have completed the final exam with a score of 75/100.
